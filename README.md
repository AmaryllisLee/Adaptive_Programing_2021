# Adaptive Programming

The GitHub repository is for Adaptive Programming (AP) for the Bachelor Programme Artificial Intelligence at the University of Applied Science Utrecht.

The course AP mainly focuses on teaching OO programing in a Strongly typed language. I've chosen Java.
Furthermore, this course teaches additional skills, such as testing, domain design ( UML class diagram ) and data structures.
